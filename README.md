## Wireframes
The overall theme for this app will be a food orientated design but with plain tones such as gray, white and black. This should hopefully provide the user with the perception of both food and cleanliness / hygiene. The theme off this app will be a very simple and plain layout as the main function is to read data, it is important that the data is formatted correctly to be easy to read.

### Wireframe - Home/Landing page

This interface is designed with a simple and efficient theme. Have the bottom for both functionalities offered by the app and then the title clearly stating what the app is.

### Wireframe - Search Page

The search page has a slightly more detail design with a lot of information, however I will develop this to be easily readable and in a digestible format. The user should be able to scroll through the data and easily understand everything. At the top we have a search bar and enter button for the user to search a location. At the bottom we have a Home button allowing the user to navigate back home. 

### Wireframe - Restaurant Details

This page is designed to give the user a more in depth view at the establishment they select. This will show more information that is given in the search list but in a similar formatted and easily digestible format. The page has a simple format of the title at the top, the data in the centre. At the bottom we have a button to allow them to add this establishment to their favourite and then a home button to allow them to navigate back home.

# Reflective statement
Words: 250

Unfortunately looking back, this project was not a great success for myself. As an NESCol alumni, I was not previously taught any Java or had any introduction to Android Studio.  

Having no knowledge in the language we were going to use, I decided throughout the semester to take some time to learn Java. As a result of the Universities fast paced environment, I found myself often falling behind with course work due to me having to put in the extra work out with class to learn Java along with the new Android Studio software. Due to the amount of learning required for this topic, and my slow understanding of Java it was a steep learning curve for myself. I would often find myself in Lectures struggling to keep up with what the lecturer was doing and why they were doing it. Not due to anything the lecturer done but just due to my slow understanding because of the steep learning curve. 

Using Android Studio, could be quite frustrating and I was slow to learn itâ€™s different functions. I found the UI very frustrating and overwhelming making it quite difficult to learn. The combination of trying to learn a brand new language at the same time as this complex software, I found quite difficult. 

Reflecting back, I would definitely like to have had a more foundational knowledge within Java before beginning the class. Additionally some extra time to adjust to both the new language and complex software would have been beneficial.
