## Wireframes
The overall theme for this app will be a food orientated design but with plain tones such as gray, white and black. This should hopefully provide the user with the perception of both food and cleanliness / hygiene. The theme off this app will be a very simple and plain layout as the main function is to read data, it is important that the data is formatted correctly to be easy to read.

### Wireframe - Home/Landing page

This interface is designed with a simple and efficient theme. Have the bottom for both functionalities offered by the app and then the title clearly stating what the app is.

### Wireframe - Search Page

The search page has a slightly more detail design with a lot of information, however I will develop this to be easily readable and in a digestible format. The user should be able to scroll through the data and easily understand everything. At the top we have a search bar and enter button for the user to search a location. At the bottom we have a Home button allowing the user to navigate back home. 

### Wireframe - Restaurant Details

This page is designed to give the user a more in depth view at the establishment they select. This will show more information that is given in the search list but in a similar formatted and easily digestible format. The page has a simple format of the title at the top, the data in the centre. At the bottom we have a button to allow them to add this establishment to their favourite and then a home button to allow them to navigate back home.

### Wireframe - Favourites Page 
![image](https://github.com/kren23/BookApp_Assessment/assets/113984223/fd896a93-6901-4181-8450-702e8a4a2753)
The favourites page is a simple locally stored list that saves the details of all establishments that were favourited. The user can use a search function to filter through these results. There is also a home button to allow navigation back. 

# Reflective statement
Words: 181

Upon reflecting upon the project, it appears to have met with moderate success. During the re-sit period, a substantial proportion of my time was allocated towards understanding the intricacies of Android Studio.

However, two significant areas that did not receive the required concentration were, the management of time constraints and mastering the Java programming language. In retrospect, the complexity of Java was underestimated, leading to a longer learning curve than initially anticipated. Notwithstanding the challenges, I was ultimately able to proficiently utilise Java, albeit in a more protracted timeframe.

Furthermore, the project's time allocation was miscalculated, resulting in an insufficient allotment. This underestimation proved to be a critical impediment in the overall project timeline. Retrospectively, an additional week would have been beneficial to reach the project's completion, incorporating the database creation within the same timeframe. I do however take full responsibility for this as a result of all students crutch: procrastination.

In conclusion, this experience has provided valuable insights into effective project management, particularly with regard to time allocation and skill acquisition, lessons that I will carry forward into future undertakings.
