# Reflective statement
Words: 250

Unfortunately looking back, this project was not a great success for myself. As an NESCol alumni, I was not previously taught any Java or had any introduction to Android Studio.  

Having no knowledge in the language we were going to use, I decided throughout the semester to take some time to learn Java. As a result of the Universities fast paced environment, I found myself often falling behind with course work due to me having to put in the extra work out with class to learn Java along with the new Android Studio software. Due to the amount of learning required for this topic, and my slow understanding of Java it was a steep learning curve for myself. I would often find myself in Lectures struggling to keep up with what the lecturer was doing and why they were doing it. Not due to anything the lecturer done but just due to my slow understanding because of the steep learning curve. 

Using Android Studio, could be quite frustrating and I was slow to learn itâ€™s different functions. I found the UI very frustrating and overwhelming making it quite difficult to learn. The combination of trying to learn a brand new language at the same time as this complex software, I found quite difficult. 

Reflecting back, I would definitely like to have had a more foundational knowledge within Java before beginning the class. Additionally some extra time to adjust to both the new language and complex software would have been beneficial.
